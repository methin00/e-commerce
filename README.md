# WHAT IS IT?

It is a basic e-commerce website I developed as an exercise while improving my React skills.

# FEATURES

- A loading spinner appears while the data is being fetched.
- Responsive product listing.
- Product filtering via a search input which located in top-right corner of the page.
- Dark mode for users who prefer a low-light interface.
- A basket icon that opens a drawer from the right side when clicked.
- The basket drawer lists items responsively and shows the calculated subtotal at the bottom.
- A product details page that allows users to add multiple quantities of an item to the basket at once.



## USED TECHNOLOGIES

- Fake API Service, in order to simulate product data.
- Redux Toolkit, for centralized store management.
- React Router DOM, for seamless navigation between pages.
- Material UI, for a modern, user-friendly interface.
- Axios, for making HTTP requests to the API.
- CSS, for styling the interface.
